    <h1>Assignment - Odin Recipes</h1>

    <p>
        This is the Foundations Assignment project from The Odin Project, located <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/recipes">Here.</a>  The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time it's finished.  It’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build some basic HTML; it will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
